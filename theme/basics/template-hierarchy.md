# Template Hierarchy

As discussed, [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/ "Template files page") are modular, reusable files, used to generate the web pages on your WordPress site. Some template files (such as the header and footer template) are used on all of your site’s pages, while others are used only under specific conditions.

This article explains **how WordPress determines which template file(s) to use on individual pages**. If you want to customize an existing WordPress theme it will help you decide which template file needs to be edited.

You can also use [Conditional Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/conditional-tags/ "Conditional Tags") to control which templates are loaded on a specific page.

## The Template File Hierarchy

### Overview

WordPress uses the [query string](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#query-string) to decide which template or set of templates should be used to display the page. The query string is information that is contained in the link to each part of your website.

Put simply, WordPress searches down through the template hierarchy until it finds a matching template file. To determine which template file to use, WordPress:

1.  Matches every query string to a query type to decide which page is being requested (for example, a search page, a category page, etc);
2.  Selects the template in the order determined by the template hierarchy;
3.  Looks for template files with specific names in the current theme’s directory and uses the **first matching template file** as specified by the hierarchy.

With the exception of the basic `index.php` template file, you can choose whether you want to implement a particular template file or not.

In these examples, the PHP file extension is used. In block themes, HTML files are used instead, but the template hierarchy is the same.

If WordPress cannot find a template file with a matching name, it will skip to the next file in the hierarchy. If WordPress cannot find any matching template file, the theme’s `index.php` file will be used.

When you are using a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/), any file you add to your child theme will over-ride the same file in the parent theme. For example, both themes contain the same template `category.php`, then child theme’s template is used.  
If a child theme contains the specific template such as `category-unicorns.php` and the parent theme contains lower prioritized template such as `category.php`, then child theme’s `category-unicorns.php` is used.  
Contrary, if a child theme contains general template only such as `category.php` and the parent theme contains the specific one such as `category-unicorns.php`, then parent’s template `category-unicorns.php` is used.

### Examples

If your blog is at `http://example.com/blog/` and a visitor clicks on a link to a category page such as `http://example.com/blog/category/your-cat/`, WordPress looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory that matches the category’s ID to generate the correct page. More specifically, WordPress follows this procedure:

1.  Looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory that matches the category’s slug. If the category slug is “unicorns,” then WordPress looks for a template file named `category-unicorns.php`.
2.  If `category-unicorns.php` is missing and the category’s ID is 4, WordPress looks for a template file named `category-4.php`.
3.  If `category-4.php` is missing, WordPress will look for a generic category template file, `category.php`.
4.  If `category.php` does not exist, WordPress will look for a generic archive template, `archive.php`.
5.  If `archive.php` is also missing, WordPress will fall back to the main theme template file, `index.php`.

### Visual Overview

The following diagram shows which template files are called to generate a WordPress page based on the WordPress template hierarchy.

## The Template Hierarchy In Detail

While the template hierarchy is easier to understand as a diagram, the following sections describe the order in which template files are called by WordPress for a number of query types.

### Home Page display

By default, WordPress sets your site’s home page to display your latest blog posts. This page is called the blog posts index. You can also set your blog posts to display on a separate static page. The template file `home.php` is used to render the blog posts index, whether it is being used as the front page or on separate static page. If `home.php` does not exist, WordPress will use `index.php`.

1.  `home.php`
2.  `index.php`

If `front-page.php` exists, it will override the `home.php` template.

### Front Page display

The `front-page.php` template file is used to render your site’s front page, whether the front page displays the blog posts index (mentioned above) or a static page. The front page template takes precedence over the blog posts index (`home.php`) template. If the `front-page.php` file does not exist, WordPress will either use the `home.php` or `page.php` files depending on the setup in Settings → Reading. If neither of those files exist, it will use the `index.php` file.

1.  `front-page.php` – Used for both “**your latest posts**” or “**a static page**” as set in the **front page displays** section of Settings → Reading.
2.  `home.php` – If WordPress cannot find `front-page.php` and “**your latest posts**” is set in the **front page displays** section, it will look for `home.php`. Additionally, WordPress will look for this file when the **posts page** is set in the **front page displays** section.
3.  `page.php` – When “**front page**” is set in the **front page displays** section.
4.  `index.php` – When “**your latest posts**” is set in the **front page displays** section but `home.php` does not exist *or* when **front page** is set but `page.php` does not exist.

As you can see, there are a lot of rules to what path WordPress takes. Using the chart above is the best way to determine what WordPress will display.

### Privacy Policy Page display

The `privacy-policy.php` template file is used to render your site’s Privacy Policy page. The Privacy Policy page template takes precedence over the static page (`page.php`) template. If the `privacy-policy.php` file does not exist, WordPress will either use the `page.php` or `singular.php` files depending on the available templates. If neither of those files exist, it will use the `index.php` file.

1.  `privacy-policy.php` – Used for the Privacy Policy page set in the **Change your Privacy Policy page** section of Settings → Privacy.
2.  `custom template file` – The [page template](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/) assigned to the page. See `get_page_templates()`.
3.  `page-{slug}.php` – If the page slug is `privacy`, WordPress will look to use `page-privacy.php`.
4.  `page-{id}.php` – If the page ID is 6, WordPress will look to use `page-6.php`.
5.  `page.php`
6.  `singular.php`
7.  `index.php`

### Single Post

The single post template file is used to render a single post. WordPress uses the following path:

1.  `single-{post-type}-{slug}.php` – (Since 4.4) First, WordPress looks for a template for the specific post. For example, if [post type](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/) is `product` and the post slug is `dmc-12`, WordPress would look for `single-product-dmc-12.php`.
2.  `single-{post-type}.php` – If the post type is `product`, WordPress would look for `single-product.php`.
3.  `single.php` – WordPress then falls back to `single.php`.
4.  `singular.php` – Then it falls back to `singular.php`.
5.  `index.php` – Finally, as mentioned above, WordPress ultimately falls back to `index.php`.

### Single Page

The template file used to render a static page (`page` post-type). Note that unlike other post-types, `page` is special to WordPress and uses the following path:

1.  `custom template file` – The [page template](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/) assigned to the page. See `[get_page_templates()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_page_templates/)`.
2.  `page-{slug}.php` – If the page slug is `recent-news`, WordPress will look to use `page-recent-news.php`.
3.  `page-{id}.php` – If the page ID is 6, WordPress will look to use `page-6.php`.
4.  `page.php`
5.  `singular.php`
6.  `index.php`

### Category

Rendering category archive index pages uses the following path in WordPress:

1.  `category-{slug}.php` – If the category’s slug is `news`, WordPress will look for `category-news.php`.
2.  `category-{id}.php` – If the category’s ID is `6`, WordPress will look for `category-6.php`.
3.  `category.php`
4.  `archive.php`
5.  `index.php`

### Tag

To display a tag archive index page, WordPress uses the following path:

1.  `tag-{slug}.php` – If the tag’s slug is `sometag`, WordPress will look for `tag-sometag.php`.
2.  `tag-{id}.php` – If the tag’s ID is `6`, WordPress will look for `tag-6.php`.
3.  `tag.php`
4.  `archive.php`
5.  `index.php`

### Custom Taxonomies

[Custom taxonomies](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies/) use a slightly different template file path:

1.  `taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php` – If the taxonomy is `sometax`, and taxonomy’s term is `someterm`, WordPress will look for `taxonomy-sometax-someterm.php.` In the case of [post formats](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/post-formats/), the taxonomy is ‘post\_format’ and the terms are ‘post-format-{format}. i.e. `taxonomy-post_format-post-format-link.php` for the link post format.
2.  `taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php` – If the taxonomy were `sometax`, WordPress would look for `taxonomy-sometax.php`.
3.  `taxonomy.php`
4.  `archive.php`
5.  `index.php`

### Custom Post Types

[Custom Post Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/) use the following path to render the appropriate archive index page.

1.  `archive-{post_type}.php` – If the post type is `product`, WordPress will look for `archive-product.php`.
2.  `archive.php`
3.  `index.php`

(For rendering a single post type template, refer to the [single post display](#single-post "Single Post Display") section above.)

### Author display

Based on the above examples, rendering author archive index pages is fairly explanatory:

1.  `author-{nicename}.php` – If the author’s nice name is `matt`, WordPress will look for `author-matt.php`.
2.  `author-{id}.php` – If the author’s ID were `6`, WordPress will look for `author-6.php`.
3.  `author.php`
4.  `archive.php`
5.  `index.php`

### Date

Date-based archive index pages are rendered as you would expect:

1.  `date.php`
2.  `archive.php`
3.  `index.php`

### Search Result

Search results follow the same pattern as other template types:

1.  `search.php`
2.  `index.php`

### 404 (Not Found)

Likewise, 404 template files are called in this order:

1.  `404.php`
2.  `index.php`

### Attachment

Rendering an attachment page (`attachment` post-type) uses the following path:

1.  `{MIME-type}.php` – can be any [MIME type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type") (For example: `image.php`, `video.php`, `pdf.php`). For `text/plain`, the following path is used (in order):
    1.  `text-plain.php`
    2.  `plain.php`
    3.  `text.php`
2.  `attachment.php`
3.  `single-attachment-{slug}.php` – For example, if the attachment slug is `holiday`, WordPress would look for `single-attachment-holiday.php`.
4.  `single-attachment.php`
5.  `single.php`
6.  `singular.php`
7.  `index.php`

As of WordPress 6.4, attachment pages are [no longer enabled by default](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/) on new installations. Users can enable them with a plugin, so it is still good practice to test your theme and ensure it properly displays content when viewing an attachment page.

### Embeds

The embed template file is used to render a post which is being embedded. Since 4.5, WordPress uses the following path:

1.  `embed-{post-type}-{post_format}.php` – First, WordPress looks for a template for the specific post. For example, if its post type is `post` and it has the audio format, WordPress would look for `embed-post-audio.php`.
2.  `embed-{post-type}.php` – If the post type is `product`, WordPress would look for `embed-product.php`.
3.  `embed.php` – WordPress then falls back to embed`.php`.
4.  Finally, WordPress ultimately falls back to its own `wp-includes/theme-compat/embed.php` template.

## Non-ASCII Character Handling

Since WordPress 4.7, any dynamic part of a template name which includes non-ASCII characters in its name actually supports both the un-encoded and the encoded form, in that order. You can choose which to use.

Here’s the page template hierarchy for a page named “Hello World 😀” with an ID of `6`:

*   `page-hello-world-😀.php`
*   `page-hello-world-%f0%9f%98%80.php`
*   `page-6.php`
*   `page.php`
*   `singular.php`

The same behaviour applies to post slugs, term names, and author nicenames.

## Filter Hierarchy

The WordPress template system lets you filter the hierarchy. This means that you can insert and change things at specific points of the hierarchy. The filter (located in the [`get_query_template()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_query_template/) function) uses this filter name: `"{$type}_template"` where `$type` is the template type.

Here is a list of all available filters in the template hierarchy:

*   `embed_template`
*   `404_template`
*   `search_template`
*   `frontpage_template`
*   `home_template`
*   `privacypolicy_template`
*   `taxonomy_template`
*   `attachment_template`
*   `single_template`
*   `page_template`
*   `singular_template`
*   `category_template`
*   `tag_template`
*   `author_template`
*   `date_template`
*   `archive_template`
*   `index_template`

### Example

For example, let’s take the default author hierarchy:

*   `author-{nicename}.php`
*   `author-{id}.php`
*   `author.php`

To add `author-{role}.php` before `author.php`, we can manipulate the actual hierarchy using the ‘author\_template’ template type. This allows a request for /author/username where username has the role of editor to display using author-editor.php if present in the current themes directory.

```php
function author_role_template( $templates = '' ) {
	$author = get_queried_object();
	$role   = $author->roles[0];

	if ( ! is_array( $templates ) && ! empty( $templates ) ) {
		$templates = locate_template( array( "author-$role.php", $templates ), false );
	} elseif ( empty( $templates ) ) {
		$templates = locate_template( "author-$role.php", false );
	} else {
		$new_template = locate_template( array( "author-$role.php" ) );

		if ( ! empty( $new_template ) ) {
			array_unshift( $templates, $new_template );
		}
	}
	return $templates;
}
add_filter( 'author_template', 'author_role_template' );
```

Changelog:

*   **Updated** 2022-02-15. Added a notice explaining that the template hierarchy is the same for classic and block themes, but that the examples uses .php files and block themes use .html files.
