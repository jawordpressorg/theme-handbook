# Core Concepts

Welcome to the Core Concepts documentation. The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the foundational concepts necessary for creating your own WordPress block themes.

The focus of this chapter is to help you familiarize yourself with the basic theme structure and standard files like `style.css`, `functions.php`, and `theme.json`. Once you have these core concepts down, you can more comfortably dive into the later chapters in this handbook.
