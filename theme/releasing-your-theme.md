# Releasing Your Theme

This section covers the requirements and submission process for releasing your theme into the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/). If you’ve followed the instructions in this handbook, your theme is almost ready for release into the directory.

The first requirement to releasing your theme is to make sure you have – at a minimum – the [required theme files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/required-theme-files/) before submitting your theme for review.

Once you’ve confirmed the required theme files, thorough [testing](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/testing/) of the theme – including content – must be completed. Following the [theme review guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/theme-review-guidelines/) will help ensure acceptance of your theme.

After completing everything above, having the proper [documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/writing-documentation/) is the final step before [submitting your theme for approval](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/submitting-your-theme-to-wordpress-org/). After submitting your theme for review, the theme reviewer may request other changes to your theme.

## Important Notices

Themes that have **3 or more distinct issues may be closed** as not-approved. Theme authors are encouraged to review the [Theme Review Guidelines](//developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/theme-review-guidelines/).

  
[“How to do a review (Draft)”](//make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/how-to-do-a-review-draft/) is another practical guide to understand the review process in-depth.  

## First Two Checks

### **1\. Commonly missed requirements**

Here are some of the commonly missed requirements at the initial review. Themes with incomplete requirements may be closed as not-approved.

*   Themes must be compatible with the GNU General Public License. GPLv2 or later is strongly recommended.
*   Themes are not allowed to include plugins and non-design related functionalities such as forms. Anything that will be deleted when user switches a theme should not be included.
*   Shortcodes, custom post types, and custom blocks are not allowed in themes.

### 2\. **Testing your theme with Theme Check Plugin**

Theme Check plugin is an easy way to test your theme and ensure it’s up to spec with the latest theme review standards. Learn more about [Theme Check Plugin](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/theme-check-plugin/).
