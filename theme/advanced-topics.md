# Advanced Theme Topics

In this section, we’ll look at some advanced theme topics.

We’ll start with the use of [Child Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/ "Child Themes") for modifying aspects of the theme.

We’ll also look at [User Interface (UI) Best Practices](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/ui-best-practices/ "UI Best Practices") and [JavaScript Best Practices](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/javascript-best-practices/ "JavaScript Best Practices"). This is followed by performing checks of the theme using [Theme Unit Tests](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/theme-testing/ "Theme Unit Tests") and [validating the theme’s markup](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/validating-your-theme/ "Validating Your Theme").

Finally, we’ll look at ensuring your theme works well with [Plugin API Hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/plugin-api-hooks/ "Plugin API Hooks").
