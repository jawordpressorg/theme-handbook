# Localization

## What is localization?

Localization describes the subsequent process of translating an internationalized theme. Localization is abbreviated as `l10n` (because there are 10 letters between the l and the n.)

Please refer to the [Localization](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/handbook/internationalization/localization/) page on the [Common APIs handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/) to learn how to Localize your theme.
