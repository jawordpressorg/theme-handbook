# Block themes

A block theme is a type of WordPress theme built using blocks. You can edit all parts of a block theme in the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/).

WordPress supports block themes from version 5.9. Together with the [Styles interface](https://wordpress.org/support/article/styles-overview/), block themes are part of the new site editing feature. Block themes are sometimes called full site editing themes. [Learn more about the site editing feature](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/full-site-editing/).

## The benefits of block themes

Why should you create block themes? While WordPress continues to support classic themes, block themes are built to improve scalability and performance.

*   [Block themes enhances loading performance](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/01/block-styles-loading-enhancements-in-wordpress-5-8/)Â by loading styles only for rendered blocks on a page
*   Block themes are not required to manually enqueue stylesheets for both front-end and editors
*   Theme.json handles all aspects of [add\_theme\_support()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_theme_support/)
*   Accessibility features such as Skip to content, keyboard navigation, and landmarks are generated automatically without adding additional code
*   With a block theme, the user can edit all parts of their website without code
*   By using the Styles interface, users can customize colors and typography for the website and for the blocks

## Differences and similarities between classic themes and block themes

Many concepts and features are the same for both classic and block themes, and in some cases, the handbook will refer to a chapter about classic themes.

For theme developers that are accustomed to creating classic themes, there is a comparison table:
