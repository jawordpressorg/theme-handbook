# Features

Welcome to the Features documentation. In this chapter, you will learn about various features supported by the WordPress block theming system.

This chapter does not have a singular focus. Instead, it offers information on several different topics that will help you work with more advanced features, stepping beyond the basics that you learned in [Global Settings and Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/) and [Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/).
