# Lightbox

`settings.lightbox` is a specific setting that you can enable for supported blocks. It enables a lightbox feature that expands an image when a site visitor clicks on an image.

This setting is only available as of WordPress 6.4 and is specific to the core Image block (`core/image`).

## Lightbox settings

The `lightbox` setting is specific to the Image block, so the following examples will be shown in that context.

The `lightbox` property is an object that has two nested properties that you can configure:

*   **`enabled`:** Whether to enable the lightbox feature for the Image block. The default value is `undefined` (the equivalent of being disabled).
*   **`allowEditing`:** Whether to show the **Expand on click** option in the interface, which allows the user to enable/disable lightbox for individual images. Defaults to `true`.

Here is a look at the default `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"lightbox": {
					"allowEditing": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Enabling lightbox for images

To enable the lightbox feature for Image blocks used throughout the site, you must set `settings.blocks.core/image.lightbox.enabled` to true in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"lightbox": {
					"enabled": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

On the front-end of the site, visitors will be able to expand the image when clicking on it. The image will then overlay the entire screen (including an **x** button for closing the overlay), as shown below:

### Disabling user editing

By default, WordPress will show an **Expand on Click** option under the **Settings** tab for the Image block:

[![WordPress post editor with an Image block showing the "expand on click" option selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/lightbox-allow-editing.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/lightbox-allow-editing.jpg?ssl=1)

This control allows your themeâ€™s users to enable or disable the lightbox feature on a per-block basis.

To disallow user editing, you must set `settings.blocks.core/image.lightbox.allowEditing` to `false` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"lightbox": {
					"allowEditing": false
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
