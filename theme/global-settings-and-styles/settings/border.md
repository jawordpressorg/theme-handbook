# Border

The `settings.border` property in `theme.json` gives you control over the global border settings for blocks in WordPress. Itâ€™s important to note that this lets you configure the available settings in the user interface, not the border styles themselves.

Each of the border settings maps to a control at the individual block level and in the **Styles** interface for blocks, letting you curate which controls are available to your theme users:

## Border settings

WordPress supports four border settings that you can configure via the `settings.border` property in `theme.json`. Each of them allows you to enable or disable a specific border feature and accepts a boolean (`true` or `false`) value:

*   **`color`:** Enables/Disables the border-color picker.
*   **`radius`:** Enables/Disables the border-radius control.
*   **`style`:** Enables/Disables the border-style selector (users have the option of `solid`, `dashed`, or `dotted`).
*   `**width**`: Enables/Disables the border-width input.

By default, all border properties are set to `false`, as shown in this example `theme.json` code:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"color": false,
			"radius": false,
			"style": false,
			"width": false
		}
	}
}
```

As of WordPress 6.3, `color`, `style`, and `width` are intertwined. If any one of them is set to `true`, the others will be available as options within the user interface.

Also, setting the `radius` option to `false` does not work for the Button block. The border-radius control in the editor always appears.
