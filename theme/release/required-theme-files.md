# Required Theme Files

Before you submit your theme for review, you must make sure that certain files are included. These files must follow template file standards set by the Theme Review Team. In addition to the files below, there are several other standard template files that we recommend you use, as discussed on the [Organizing Theme Files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/) page.

## Required Theme Files

1.  **style.css  
    **Your theme’s main [stylesheet](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/) file. This file will also include information about your theme, such as author name, version number, and plugin URL, in it’s header.
2.  **index.php  
    **The main [template file](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/page-templates/) for your theme. This will be the template for the homepage on your site unless a static front page is specified. If you *only* include this template file, it must include all functionality of your theme. However, you can use as many relevant template files as you want in your theme.
3.  ****comments.php  
    ****The comment template which is included wherever comments are allowed. This file should provide support for threaded comments and trackbacks, and should style author comments differently then user comments. See the [Comments](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/comments/) page for more information.
4.  **screenshot.png**  
    In the WordPress.org theme directory, screenshot.png acts as a visual indicator of what your theme looks like. It is visible both in the web view and in the admin dashboard. Note: this screenshot can be no larger than 1200x900px.

While these files are the only files required by the theme review team for acceptance into the WordPress.org theme directory, you may use other template files. Of course, any file mentioned in the tutorial in this handbook may be used in your theme.
