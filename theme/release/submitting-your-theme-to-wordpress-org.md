# Submitting Your Theme to WordPress.org

Before themes are added to the WordPress Theme Directory, they are closely reviewed by the [Theme Review team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) to make sure they adhere to basic [guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/). This review ensures that WordPress users across the globe can download themes that are high quality and secure.

## Need Help?

If you have theme development questions, please post them in the [Developing with WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/wp-advanced/) forum. Volunteers from around the world are ready to assist you with the development of your theme.

## Guidelines

Make sure you review the [Theme Review Guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/) before uploading a theme. If you have questions about these guidelines, you can ask them in the [#themereview](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/themereview/) channel in [Slack](https://chat.wordpress.org/). Anyone with a WordPress.org account can access the Making WordPress Slack.

## Testing With Sample Data

The [WordPress Theme Review Team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) will be reviewing your theme using the sample data from the [Theme Unit Test](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/release/testing/). Before uploading your theme for review, please test it with this sample export data.

## Uploading Your Theme

When you are ready to submit your theme for review, please upload your theme ZIP at [Themes > Upload](https://wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/). Future updates are to be uploaded via the same page.

More information about the theme review process is available on the [Theme Review Team’s website](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/).

## Updating Your Theme

Regardless of whether your theme is approved or waiting for review, if you are uploading a theme update, simply increase the version inside of style.css and upload the themename.zip file again, just like you do with a new theme. Increasing version will NOT change queue position of your theme (if still waiting for review).
